# twinkie
Twinkie is designed as a tool to support test automation of web surfaces. It should allow the user to enter test 
specification in human readable format and it should deliver testable code.


The main concepts:
 
 - UiElement: the properties that identify an element on the surface (like "by-id" and "value") 
 - Selector: the input required by a test engine to identify a UiElement (like: "id=my-html-id")
